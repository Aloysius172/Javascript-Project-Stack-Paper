Background

  This project was inspired by my love of sports and the sport I played growing 
up, football. I am creating a game where a reciever can move left or right to catch 
footballs as they fall from random starting positions overhead in attempts to set 
a high score for footballs caught.

Funtionality & MVP

In Fair Catch, users will be able to:
1. Slide left and right across the game screen using left and right arrow keys.
2. See footballs drop from the top of the game screen toward the ground.
3. Have footballs be "caught" by reciever.
4. Add to their "footballs caught" score.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
  
1. This project is to be built primarily manipulating HTML Canvas element.
2. Webpack and Babel to transpile and the source Javascript code.
3. npm to manage project dependencies.
